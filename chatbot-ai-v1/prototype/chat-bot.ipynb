    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this Jupyter Notebook is to enable new team members to easily prototype a new chain using LangChain. This chain aims to improve the performance of an existing chatbot or test its current performance. The notebook will serve as both documentation and a prototyping tool, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the codebase and facilitating smooth onboarding for new developers.\n",
    "This chatbot is designed to interact with the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) rulebook, providing users with accurate and relevant information based on their queries. By leveraging LangChain, we can seamlessly integrate multiple components to create a robust chatbot solution.\n"
