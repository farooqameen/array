Tell me in general what are the content of the CBB rulebook,"The CBB Rulebook contains the following key content: 

The CBB Rulebook is issued by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) pursuant to the Central Bank of Bahrain and Financial Institutions Law 2006 ('the CBB Law').  The CBB Law provides for two formal rulemaking instruments: Regulations (made pursuant to Article 37) and Directives (made pursuant to Article 38).  The Rulebook also includes various specific requirements prescribed by other articles in the CBB Law, such as those relating to licensing and the notification and approval of controllers of licensees. 

The Rulebook is divided into different modules, and the Purpose Section of each Module specifies the rulemaking instrument(s) used to issue the content of that Module, as well as the legal basis underpinning the Module's requirements. 

Rules have a binding effect, and if a licensee breaches a Rule, it is liable to enforcement action by the CBB and, in certain cases, criminal proceedings by the Office of the Public Prosecutor. ​
​
Guidance, on the other hand, is not binding but rather helps inform a particular Rule or set of Rules, or provides other general information. Compliance with Guidance will generally lead the CBB to assess that the relevant Rule(s) have been complied with, while failure to comply with Guidance will generally be viewed as tending to suggest a breach of a Rule. ​
​
The status of each paragraph in the Rulebook is identified by its text format, with Rules in bold and font size 12.  ​

The data source indicates that the CBB will consider several factors when assessing a request from a licensee to add the activity of export/import of bank notes to its permitted activities. One of these factors is ""the legal status and regulatory track record of the licensee including previous disciplinary measures taken against the licensee by the CBB or any other jurisdiction in which its group operates.""
