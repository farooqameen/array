It supplements Article 61 of the CBB Law, which requires licensees to appoint an external auditor acceptable to the CBB. |\\n\\nLegal Basis\\n\\nAU-A.1.3\\n\\n\\nThis Module contains the CBB's Directive (as amended from time to\\ntime) relating to auditors and accounting standards used by\\nconventional bank licensees, and is issued under the powers available\\nto the CBB under Article 38 of the CBB Law.

It was subsequently reissued in full in July 2006 (and renamed ‘Auditors and Accounting Standards'). |\\n| AU-A.2.2 | The reissued Module was one of several Modules modified to reflect the introduction of the CBB's new integrated license framework. Although the new framework did not change the substance of the requirements contained in this Module, the Module was re-issued in order to simplify its drafting and layout and align it with equivalent Modules in other Volumes of the CBB Rulebook. |\\n| AU-A.2.3 | This Module is dated July 2006. Pages that are subsequently changed in this Module are updated with the end-calendar quarter date in which the change was made: Chapter UG-3 provides further details on Rulebook maintenance and version control. |\\n| AU-A.2.4 | When the CBB replaced the BMA in September 2006, the provisions of this Module remained in force. Volume 1 was updated in October 2007 to reflect the switch to the CBB; however, new calendar quarter dates were only issued where the update necessitated changes to actual requirements. |\\n| AU-A.2.5 | A list of changes made to this Module is provided below: Module Reference Change Date Description of Changes |\" metadata={'link': 'https://cbben.thomsonreuters.com/sites/default/files/net_file_store/Vol_1_AU_October_2022.pdf', 'name': 'Vol_1_AU_October_2022.txt', 'path': 'Central Bank of Bahrain Volume 1—Conventional Banks/Part A/Vol_1_AU_October_2022.pdf', 'rules': ['AU-A', 'AU-4.1', 'UG-3', 'AU-A.1', 'AU-5.4', 'AU-A.2.1', 'AU-5.2', 'AU-A.2.5', 'AU-A.2.4', 'AU-5.5', 'AU-A.1.2', 'AU-A.2.3', 'AU-A.1.1', 'UG-1.1', 'AU-A.2.2', 'AU-A.2', 'AU-5.1', 'AU-A.1.4', 'AU-5.3', 'AU-A.1.3', 'AU-5', 'BR-6.5', 'AU-4']}\n",
