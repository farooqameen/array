This is the front-end of the Jade project created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, if it is your first time running the project you will need to install nodejs to get the npm (a javascript package manager, you will need admin permission to download it.). After npm is installed , make sure you are inside the project directory and run :

```bash
npm i
```

After the packages get installed , run the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
